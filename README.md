# Feedbackland - Turn feedback into your roadmap

Feedbackland provides an easy-to-embed React widget for collecting feature requests, bug reports, and any other feedback directly in your app. Then our AI aggregates and analyzes all user inputs, discovers overarching themes & patterns, and creates your prioritized, actionable product roadmap. So you can build with certainty what users really want. No guessing required!

Open-source & self-hostable, or available as a start-free cloud-hosted version embedded in 30 seconds.
