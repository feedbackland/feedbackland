## How it works

1. Add our widget (aka 'the feedback button') to your React or Next.js app in seconds
2. Users click the button to submit ideas and issues. And view, upvote and comment on feedback.
3. AI analyzes all feedback, uncovers patterns and themes, and writes an actionable roadmap.
4. You follow the roadmap to ship what users love. ðŸš€

## Get started

To start, simply add the snippet below to your React or Next.js app.

```
npm i feedbackland-react
```

```tsx
import { FeedbackButton } from 'feedbackland-react';

<FeedbackButton
  platformId="A-RANDOMLY-GENERATED-UUIDv4" // generate it here: https://www.uuidtools.com/v4
  mode="" // 'dark' or 'light', defaults to 'light'
  text="" // the copy text of the button, defaults to 'Feedback'
  className="" // style the button with Tailwind
  style={} // or style it with native CSS
  button={} // or bring your own button
/>
```
