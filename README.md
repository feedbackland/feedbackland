## About

Feedbackland is an open-source feedback platform you can self-host or use as a convenient cloud solution. Whether you embed it as a widget in your app, or use the standalone site, it collects user feedback and uses AI to generate your actionable roadmap. Our cloud plan features a generous free tier with unlimited feedback from unlimited end-users (no per-user tracking!). Our promise: We will never punish your success with expensive pricing or artificial usage caps.
