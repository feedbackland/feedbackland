[Feedbackland](https://www.feedbackland.com) is a free, open-source and self-hostable feedback platform that lets you collect user feedback using a widget and via a standalone website, and auto-generate a prioritized roadmap based on all gathered feedback. It can be considered a 'light' open-source and non-commercial alternative to Canny.

Create your free [cloud-hosted platform](https://get-started.feedbackland.com) in seconds, or [self-host](https://github.com/feedbackland/feedbackland/blob/main/SELFHOSTING.md) your platform.
