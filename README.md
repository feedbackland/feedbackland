Feedbackland is a feedback platform that collects feedback, upvotes and comments from your users either directly in your app via an easily embeddable widget, or as a standalone feedback website. It's fully open-source, self-hostable and available as a convenient cloud-hosted option with a generous free tier that includes unlimited feedback from unlimited end-users (no tracked users!). Feedbackland's promise is to never punish growth with expensive pricing models that don't scale.
