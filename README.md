## How it Works:

- 🗣️ The Widget Captures Feedback – Embed the widget in your React app to collect feature requests, bug reports, and ideas directly from your users.
- 🤖 AI Writes Your Roadmap – Feedbackland’s AI analyzes, aggregates and clusters feedback, votes, and comments, then generates your prioritized roadmap.
- 🚀 You Build What Users Love — Use the roadmap to plan sprints, build features, and ship the product your users love.
