## About

FeedbackLand is an open-source, self-hostable feedback platform. It includes a React widget to capture feedback directly in your app and uses AI to produce a prioritized roadmap that shows exactly which features and bug fixes your users want.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## How it works

üó£Ô∏è The Widget Captures Feedback ‚Äì Embed our React widget and capture user feedback directly in-app.

ü§ñ AI Writes Your Roadmap ‚Äì AI analyzes, clusters and transforms feedback into your prioritized roadmap.

üöÄ You Build What Your Users Love ‚Äî Use the roadmap to build the features your users will love.

## Embed the widget in 30 seconds
   
1. Install the `feedbackland-react` package
```
npm i feedbackland-react
```
2. Copy-paste the `FeedbackButton` snippet into your React app (e.g. inside of your UI's sidebar or menu)
```tsx
import { FeedbackButton } from 'feedbackland-react';

<FeedbackButton
  platformId="<YOUR-GENERATED-UUID-V4>" //go to www.uuidtools.com/v4 to generate your UUID
  mode="" // 'dark' or 'light', defaults to 'dark'
  text="" // the copy text of the button, defaults to 'Feedback'
  className="" // style the button with Tailwind
  style="" // or style it with native CSS
  button={} // or bring your own button
/>
```
3. Set the `platformId` prop to a new [randomly generated UUID v4](https://www.uuidtools.com/v4). This will be your platform's identifier.

4. Deploy your app, start collecting feedback and generate your first roadmap!
