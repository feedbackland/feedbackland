# Feedbackland

Feedbackland is an easy-to-use, open-source feedback platform designed to be embedded directly into your React app. It collects user feedback, then uses AI to transform it into a crystal-clear, prioritized roadmap. So you know exactly what to build next. No triaging or guessing needed.

## How it works

🗣️ The widget collects feedback – Embed our React widget and capture user feedback directly in-app.

⬆️ Your users surface top ideas - Users vote and comment to identify the most important ideas, issues and requests.

🤖 AI writes your roadmap – Our AI analyzes and clusters feedback, votes, and comments, then turns them into a clear, prioritized roadmap.

🚀 You build what users want – You use the roadmap to build the features your users will love.
