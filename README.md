# Feedbackland: The self-writing roadmap

Embed our widget to capture user feedback. Watch as AI analyzes patterns, uncovers hidden insights, and automatically builds your product roadmap. No manual sorting, no guesswork, just data-driven clarity on what to build next.

## How it works

1. üó£Ô∏è The widget collects user feedback directly in-app.
3. ü§ñ Our AI analyzes, uncovers overarching themes and hidden insights, then writes your prioritized roadmap
4. üöÄ You use the roadmap to build what users really want. No guessing required!

## Preview the widget

[Visit Feedbackland's website](https://www.feedbackland.com) to preview & test-drive the widget.

## Embed the widget

Embed Feedbackland in 30 seconds in your React/Nextjs app:

```
npm i feedbackland-react
```

```tsx
import { FeedbackButton } from 'feedbackland-react';

<FeedbackButton
  platformId="<RANDOMLY-GENERATED-UUIDV4>" // required, a UUID v4, generate one here: https://www.uuidtools.com/v4
  mode="" // optional, 'dark' or 'light', defaults to 'dark'
  text="" // optional, the copy text of the button, defaults to 'Feedback'
  className="" // optional, style the button with Tailwind
  style={} // optional, style the button with native CSS
/>
```

Alternatively [get your code snippet](https://www.feedbackland.com/#embed) with a pre-filled `platformId` from the Feedbackland website.
