## Why use Feedbackland?

- **Effortlessly capture feedback** - Capturing feedback is incredibly easy with our widget, which embeds in seconds and lets users submit ideas and report bugs directly within your application.

- **Know exactly what to build next** - Our AI analyzes and synthesizes all feedback into a prioritized product roadmap, telling you precisely what users want and what to build next.

- **Engage directly with users** - Directly communicate with users through comments. Discuss feedback, ask questions, and show them you're listening.

- **Keep everyone in the loop** - Close the feedback loop. Update posts with statuses like 'In Progress' and 'Done' to communicate progress transparently and build trust.
