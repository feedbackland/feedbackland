# Feedbackland - Widget In → Roadmap Out

Feedbackland provides an easy-to-embed React widget for collecting feature requests, bug reports, and general user feedback directly in your app. Users can upvote and comment; Feedbackland aggregates and analyzes that input and auto-generates a prioritized, actionable product roadmap using our AI Roadmap engine. Open-source & self-hostable, or available as a free to start cloud-hosted version embedded in 30 seconds.
