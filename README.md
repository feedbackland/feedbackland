## Why Feedbackland?

Most feedback tools charge per seat, gate features behind tiers, and lock you into their ecosystem. Feedbackland is different:

- **Free forever, no limits.** Unlimited feedback, users, and admins. MIT licensed. No upgrade walls.
- **AI that actually helps.** Auto-generate a prioritized roadmap from raw feedback, or ask questions like *"What do users hate about the login flow?"* and get cited answers instantly.
- **Works where your users are.** Standalone board, embeddable widget, or drop-in React/Next.js components — your call.
- **Modern stack, no compromises.** Next.js 16, TypeScript, tRPC, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Kysely, and Postgres.
