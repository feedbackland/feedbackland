# Feedbackland

Open-source widget that captures feedback and automatically transforms it into your prioritized roadmap. No triaging. No guesswork. Just clarity on what to build next.

## How it Works

- 🗣️ The Widget Captures Feedback – Embed our widget in your React app to capture user feedback directly in-app.
- 🤖 AI Writes Your Roadmap – AI analyzes, aggregates and clusters feedback, then generates your prioritized roadmap.
- 🚀 You Build What Users Love — Use the roadmap to build the features and ship the product your users love.
